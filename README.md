## 'A Simple Day'
I stared at the whiteboard filled with all sorts of equations, I sighed, I only looked away for a minute or was it two how did I miss so much, Mr. Thomson is already on the other side of the board. “Brrrrrrrrring” the bell pierces through my ears distracting me from my thoughts. This, this is depressing, now I have more notes to complete, ughhhhhhhhhh, I already have enough to do as is already. I got up, took out my camera and took a quick picture of the notes I had left to copy down, and left the classroom, the hallway was packed with every student trying to get out and go home, I pulled my phone out of my back pocket to text mum, just let her know I will be home a little later. I want to check out the new café in our neighborhood, After texting my mum about my whereabouts for the next hour, I put my phone back into my back pocket, looking up I noticed a double rainbow in the sky, how many time do you see a double rainbow I enjoyed this magnificent sight before I quickly pull out my portable camera from my backpack and took as many photos as I could then I’ll edit the photos later and post it on my Instagram when I get home. I wish the phone had already built-in cameras in the phone, it would be nice to not have to carry my camera around all the time or must transfer my photos to a computer first before I can upload it. It would be a lot easier and more convenient; I wonder who I have to talk to about this idea of mine. I walked another 5 minutes before I saw the cute new restaurant that had been the talk of the neighborhood and school. I went into the store, took a seat, and began looking through the menu board behind the counter, the café has a very unique modern interior design to it, I decided to get myself a coffee mocha with whipped cream that would be a nice treat and maybe I get a cookie as well, I got up to place my order, I spent the next couple minutes admiring the interior design I brought out my camera to take some (a lot actually) pictures of the place (more photos for my Instagram). I finished my coffee, ate my cookie, and began to pack my things to leave the café then I remember I did not get anything for my siblings, I went back to the counter and got some cookies, then I headed home.
Fast forward to the next day, it is the weekend, and I was able to get all my homework done not long after lunch and now I can upload my pictures, I had to transfer my pictures from yesterday to my computer, well technically the family computer then I upload it to my social media account. This took up too much of my time, I spent at least 20-25 minutes looking through all the pictures, then thinking of a caption and some hashtags took me about another 20 minutes it is hard coming up with those, wish I were more creative. After another 30 minutes of mindless scrolling through Instagram I got tired of sitting down, I went to my room laid on my bed, and called some of my friends we talked for about an hour and decided to meet up at the new café together at about half an hour from now, I got ready relatively quick I’m bored at home. I told my mum I was leaving the house and will be back by around 8:30 pm I was just going to be at the café which was about 5 minutes from our home. I only moved with my phone and my wallet I do not really need anything else; I got to the café and found my friends Mindy and Tom waiting for me, I hope they did not wait too long after getting settled and ordering our snacks. I suggested we take pictures to post on our social media accounts, sadly neither one of us brought our cameras so we just called it a night and went home. We will take pictures at the café another day. I did enjoy stepping out of the house for a bit, I’m actually glad we didn’t take pictures I did not want the hassle of having to transfer my pictures before I uploaded them, it’s a bit stressful.



## Micro Essay 
In my story I did not want to make any drastic changes, I just made my alternative universe a universe where built-in camera phones or camera’s in computer systems do not exist and you must carry around a portable camera to capture your moments or just enjoy the moment, experience it instead of trying to capture in for your social media feed. “That new media remediates old media (Bolter and Grusin 1999) seems an intuitive way to understand this cultural situation in which notions of old and new at times become indistinct. New media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us. They are continuously remediated, resurfacing, finding new users contexts adaptation ….”  This quote relates to my story in the sense that the phones in the story are the same as the brick phones but are recreated to have more space and larger screens, but no cameras built-in. Old media never dies, or it can never die it will continue to be reused, reformed, and recreated. Just like the phones in this story even though they lack the camera feature we are so used to today; it still has the same features that are required of a phone to have. The only way people can upload pictures to their social media is through their computer systems, but they would have to take pictures with their cameras first. This is not a drastic change I just wanted to tell a simple story that will show the inconvenience when something that seems so obvious is taken away. Because there are not cameras built-in phone social media like Instagram will all be like how Facebook originally was is to be accessed through the computer system. Without a built-in camera in mobile phones, a lot of the social media we have today would have to find a way to make their apps accessible through websites, for example, snap chat is made solely for selfies and pictures with friends.
